# TeMoto Framework

TeMoto is a collection of software tools, i.e., a framework, that help solving common challenges in applications covering system reliability, human-robot collaboration and multi-robot systems. TeMoto is designed to work with ROS (full support) and ROS2 (in a migration stage), but the core tools can be used outside ROS.

# 

This GitHub organization contains all the software tools that make TeMoto.
